 <h1>How to add content to an MIT website</h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>In case your username is not elm, replace elm in the following code
with your username.</p>
<h2> Step 1: copy content to your www folder </h2>
<p>Let's say the file you want to add to www is called index.html, and
is in your Downloads folder, and your username is elm.  Then type:</p>
<pre>scp ~/Downloads/index.html elm@athena.dialup.mit.edu:~/www/index.html</pre>
<h2> Step 2: check that it worked </h2>
You can access your website (assuming username is elm) at: <a href =  http://web.mit.edu/elm/www/> http://web.mit.edu/elm/www/</a>
